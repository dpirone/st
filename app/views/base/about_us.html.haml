                  %br/
                  Originally from Minneapolis, he moved to Seattle to develop open-source software and is an IP Consultant and software architect in the Seattle area.  In 2000 he worked for a 'social business' (a term Muhammud Yunus coined) called Viatru that provided U.S. market opportunities for artisans in developing countries. He has also served several years as a volunteer teacher with organizations such as Technology Access Foundation and BDPA.  Finally, Tom has taken Muhammud Yunus' pledge to end poverty and he hopes that his work with SaveTogether will contribute to that.
